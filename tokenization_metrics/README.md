## Tokenization Metrics

This notebook can be used to calculate and plot the tokenization metrics we used in our paper, including the sub-word *fertility* and proportion of *continued words* ([√Åcs, 2019](http://juditacs.github.io/2019/02/19/bert-tokenization-stats.html)).
Feel free to re-use or adapt it to suit your needs. If you do, consider citing
